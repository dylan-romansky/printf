This project was one of our earliest introductions to algorithmic programming. We set out to create a function similar to printf, taking an unspecified amount of arguments and a format string, reformatting the contents of that string to present the given data, and finally printing the finished string. This was all done to show us the flaws with printf, familiarize ourselves with the benefits and shortcomings of functions that take a variable amount of arguments, and make us handle a significant amount of data processing in an orderly, structured way. As a result, it also made us familiarize ourselves with a number of common data types, how they actually work, and thus how to work with them.
